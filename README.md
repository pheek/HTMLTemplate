HTMLTemplate
============

HTML template to start a HTML/CSS/JavaScript app from scratch.
If you don't use "JavaScript", simply remove the "/js/"-Folder and the
<script>-Tag in the header (<head> of *.html).

To add new functions, edit "/js/template.js".
To add more handles, edit "/js/registerHandlers.js".

The script "rename.sh" is used to rename a small Project from "template" to an other name.
  1. copy the whole folder (including /js/ and /layout/) to your specific location.
  2. start >./rename.sh <New Name>
     eg.
     ./rename.sh HelloWorld
